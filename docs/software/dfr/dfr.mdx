# Dynamic Foveated Rendering

As of Baballonia `1.1.0.9RC10` (or any build you can get off of [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4091970/Project_Babble_Baballonia/)), Baballonia supports [dynamic foveated rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveated_rendering) (DFR) via Pimax's [Magic4All](https://github.com/mbucchia/PimaxMagic4All).

For the uninitiated, DFR is a rendering technique that uses eye tracking to draw what you're looking at with high fidelity and regions you're not at lower ones. It's (basically) a free performance gain!
