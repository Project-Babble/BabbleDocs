# Custom Camera Stream Behavior

The Baballonia SDK allows developers to create their own camera stream sources by extending the abstract `Capture` class. This system unifies how Baballonia interacts with any camera type—USB webcams, Varjo eye-tracking cameras, Android/IP streams, V4L2 devices, or fully custom experimental hardware.

Custom capture sources integrate directly into Baballonia **without modifying the core application**, thanks to the plugin-based capture factory system.

## Understanding the `Capture` Class

Every camera source in Baballonia is implemented as a subclass of the `Capture` base class:

```csharp
public abstract class Capture(string source, ILogger logger) : IDisposable
