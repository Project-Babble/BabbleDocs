Open Sauce was a blast! Here are some photos from the event:

Flying in was a visual treat. Set up was relatively painless, here was our view up and down the hall from our booth:

And of course, our booth itself. This was a collaboration between us and [SlimeVR](https://slimevr.dev/). Here, we have a Bigscreen Beyond 2E out front for passerbys to try out.

Our event wasn't purely in person. Behind us, we had a VRChat instance with a realtime 3D mesh of our booth streamed in real-time. It's one thing to try out SlimeVR/Babble trackers, it's another to see other people using them too!

Shoutout to RamesTheGeneric for making the map! For many people at our booth this their first time in VR, and they loved it!

The handsome rogue running the operation:

And of course, it wouldn't be a convention without the Pizza:

:::note
Note to reader: Calling Papa John's directly for pick up is cheaper than ordering off of DoorDash/Uber Eats etc. Like $50 cheaper.

The people next to us were pretty cool too. If anyone recognizes this fursuiter let me know!
