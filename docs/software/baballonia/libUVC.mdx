In addition to the built-in capture modules, there is also a WIP `libuvc` capture module the Babble Team is working on for *Linux*. There is currently no build available for this, you will need to compile and install it yourself [here](https://github.com/Frozenreflex/Baballonia/tree/libuvc).

You can install a capture module by placing its `.dll` into your `Modules` folder inside your install directory.
