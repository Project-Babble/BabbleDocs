# Architecture

Baballonia is an MVVM Avalonia cross-platform application using C# as its primary programming language. It has dependency injection!

Visual elements you can touch and see are represented with Models (the `.axaml` that defines how UI elements are laid out) -> View (Glue that binds the UI to business, transforms data) -> View Models (the real business logic layer).

Each ViewModel can compose Services, reusable classes, to extend functionality. Individual services are covered under the services page.
