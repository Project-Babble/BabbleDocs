# Legacy App Instructions

This guide applies to the Official Babble Tracker (and DIY versions with similar hardware/firmware) **with the Legacy App**. The first half of instructions here are the same as Baballonia.

## Getting Started
### Initial Setup

1. **Plug your tracker into your PC**
- Connect using the USB port on your tracker
- Make sure the switch is in the "ON" position, as seen below
- Two bright green lights should appear on the back of the tracker
- You should hear a connection sound when properly connected

2. **Finding your device's name**
- **Windows**
    - Press the Windows key, type "Device Manager" and press enter
    - Expand "Ports (COM & LPT)"
    - Look for a "USB Serial Device" entry - this is your tracker's COM port

- **macOS/Linux**
    - On **macOS/Linux**, the Babble Tracker with appear as a device with a `/dev/ttyACM` prefix . You can list what devices are present with `ls -ld /dev/ttyACM*`.

#### Download and install the software
- **Windows**
    - Get the latest version from here [Babble Tracker Software](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KmMBYSmAGlqDeTEjgnOOCX8YpWeeBgPb/view?usp=drive_link). Download the Project_Babble-Setup-vX.X.X.exe file and run the installer
- **macOS/Linux**
    - Use the [installer scripts](https://github.com/project-Babble/projectBabble/?tab=readme-ov-file#macos-and-linux) on the Github

#### Connect to your tracker
- Open the Project Babble software
- Click on the dropdown next to "Camera Address"
- Select the namely identified in step 2
- Click "Save and Restart Tracking" to connect

:::info
If your camera isn't present in the dropdown, just type it in.

## Setting Up The Camera Feed

Before use, you need to properly set up your camera feed:

1. **Ensure proper positioning**
- Your face should be evenly and well-illuminated
- The tracker should be able to see your entire lower face and jaw
- Positioned at a slight angle that shows the tip of your nose/nostrils

2. **Set the crop area**
- Click the "Cropping Mode" button
   
![Cropping Mode Button](/img/babbleofficaltracker/1.png)
   
- The feed may appear choppy in this mode - *this is normal*
- Click and drag across the image to set the crop area
- Make sure the cropped area includes:
    - Tip of your nose/nostrils
    - Bottom of your jaw when open
    - Sides of your cheeks when puffed

- Don't worry if the image is flipped - mirroring options are available at the bottom of the cam tab

3. **Switch to tracking mode**
- Once you've set your crop, click "Tracking Mode"

- You should now see a smooth video feed from your camera

## Calibration Process

Proper calibration is essential for accurate facial tracking:

1. **Navigate to the Calibration tab**
   
![Calibration Tab](/img/babbleofficaltracker/4.png)

2. **Perform Neutral Calibration**
- Set the calibration mode to "Neutral"

![Neutral Mode](/img/babbleofficaltracker/5.png)

- Return to the Cam tab
- Check "Enable Calibration"

![Enable Calibration](/img/babbleofficaltracker/8.png)

- Relax your face into its natural resting position
- Click "Start Calibration"

![Start Calibration](/img/babbleofficaltracker/9.png)

- You'll hear a sound indicating calibration has started
- After a few seconds, click "Stop Calibration"

![Stop Calibration](/img/babbleofficaltracker/10.png)

3. **Perform Full Calibration**
- Return to the Calibration tab
- Set the calibration mode to "Full"

![Full Mode](/img/babbleofficaltracker/6.png)

- Go back to the Cam tab
- Click "Start Calibration"
- After hearing the start sound, make as many facial expressions as possible:
    - Smile, frown, open mouth wide
    - Puff cheeks, stick out tongue
    - Move jaw side to side
- **Tip:** Keep movements natural - don't exaggerate expressions
- Calibration ends when you hear a different sound

## Fine-Tuning and Troubleshooting

If some expressions work better on one side than the other, or you need to adjust tracking sensitivity:

### Understanding the Calibration Tab

![Calibration Panel](/img/babbleofficaltracker/12.png)

The calibration panel allows you to manually adjust tracking values:

- **Left/Right**: Indicates which side of the face the shape corresponds to

![Left Right Options](/img/babbleofficaltracker/13.png)

- **Shapes**: The specific facial movement (left and/or right) being tracked (Mouth Open, Cheek Puff, etc.)

![Shape Names](/img/babbleofficaltracker/14.png)

- **Min**: The threshold at which the model starts detecting a shape

![Min Value](/img/babbleofficaltracker/15.png)

- **Max**: The maximum value the model detects for the shape

![Maximum Value](/img/babbleofficaltracker/16.png)

### Adjusting Values

- For proper tracking, minimum values should generally start at around 0.1
- Example with CheekPuff:
  - Setting Minimum to 0.4: You need significant cheek puffing before detection
  - Setting Maximum to 0.1: Slight cheek movement registers as full puffing

### Fixing Common Issues

If your jaw appears to lean in your neutral position:
- Adjust the minimum value for JawLeft until it's no longer detected when your face is at rest

**Pro Tip:** For precise adjustments, open your VR application's debug menu for the mouth tracking asset. Watch how values change as you make expressions, then return to the calibration tab to fine-tune.
