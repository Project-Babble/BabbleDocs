# Overview of Baballonia SDK

The Baballonia SDK provides developers with the tools and interfaces necessary to integrate eye-tracking and face-tracking capabilities into applications. It works seamlessly with the Baballonia desktop software, giving access to processed tracking data as well as raw camera streams.

With the SDK, developers can build custom plugins, implement new capture sources, and develop integrations inside the Baballonia application—without modifying the core codebase.

## SDK Components

### 1. `Capture` Class

`Capture` provides the framework that lets developers create their own camera capture sources. By extending the `Capture` class, you define exactly how your camera behaves and how it provides frames to Baballonia.

Baballonia currently supports:

- Standard USB webcams (UVC)
- Varjo eye-tracking cameras
- Android camera streams
- IP cameras
- V4L2 devices on Linux
- Custom or experimental capture sources

This system allows all of these devices to work through a unified interface inside of Baballonia.

### 2. `ICaptureFactory` Interface

Every custom camera backend must provide a corresponding `ICaptureFactory`. A factory tells Baballonia:

- Whether it can connect to a given camera address (`CanConnect`)
- How to construct the correct `Capture` implementation (`Create`)
- What provider name should appear in the UI and logs (`GetProviderName`)

Baballonia never instantiates `Capture` classes directly.

The capture system and the `ICaptureFactory` are inseparable: a `Capture` implementation cannot function without a corresponding factory, and a factory has no purpose without a `Capture` implementation.
