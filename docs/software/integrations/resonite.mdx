# Resonite

Babble has two Resonite integrations: 
1) *Native* with the [legacy Python App](/docs/developers/sourceCode/python.mdx)
1) *Mod-based* with [hazre's VRCFTReceiver](https://github.com/hazre/VRCFTReceiver)

For the latter, please refer to the steps within [VRChat's setup page](docs/software/integrations/vrc.mdx) to get started.
