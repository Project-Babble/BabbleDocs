# Welcome to Project Babble!

Hello! This site serves as a repo for all questions, tips and tricks dealing with the project's hardware, software, and troubleshooting. 

Now, you're probably wondering:

## What is Project Babble?

Project Babble is a <i>lower-face expression tracking</i> system, designed for use with VR headsets. It works by using image input from a camera and outputs corresponding facial expressions, which in turn can be used by external apps such as VRCFaceTracking and Resonite mods.

Project Babble is designed to be hardware and OS independent. It runs with a variety of camera hardware, and runs on Windows and Linux.

### Getting started:

1. If you have any questions regarding the hardware, like what cameras you can use, you can read up on the [hardware page here](docs\intro\hardware.mdx).

1. If you have any questions regarding the software, such as how to use the Project Babble app, you can read up on the [software page here](docs\intro\software.mdx).

1. Once you've got both the hardware and software set up, head to the [integrations page here](\docs\intro\integrations\integrations.mdx).
