# ICaptureFactory Interface

The `ICaptureFactory` interface in the Baballonia SDK is the entry point for adding **custom camera sources** to Baballonia. Any new camera backend—USB, IP-based, native hardware, or experimental—must be registered through a factory so the system knows *how* to connect to it.

:::info
Every Capture Source requires a Factory.  
A factory tells Baballonia:

- **Whether it can connect** to a given address  
- **How to create the correct `Capture` subclass**  
- **What provider name** the source should appear under inside Baballonia  

This system enables full plugin-based extensibility without modifying the core application.

## Purpose of `ICaptureFactory`

Baballonia supports many types of cameras, such as:

- USB webcams  
- Varjo eye-tracking cameras  
- Android/IP camera streams  
- V4L2 devices on Linux  
- Custom or experimental camera hardware  

Each type often needs unique connection logic—for example, parsing its own address, validating availability, or allocating platform-specific resources.

The `ICaptureFactory` interface standardizes this by requiring every plugin to define:

- **How to validate an address** (`CanConnect`)  
- **How to construct the correct capture implementation** (`Create`)  
- **What name represents the provider** (`GetProviderName`)  

This ensures all camera types behave consistently inside Baballonia.
