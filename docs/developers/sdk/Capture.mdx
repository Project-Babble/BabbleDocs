# Capture

The Baballonia SDK allows developers to create their own camera stream sources by extending the abstract `Capture` class. This system unifies how Baballonia interacts with any camera type.

Custom capture sources integrate directly into Baballonia *without modifying the core application*, thanks to the plugin-based capture factory system.
