In addition to the built-in capture modules, there is also a WIP `v4l2` capture module for *Linux*. There is currently no build available for this, you will need to compile and install it yourself [here](https://github.com/DeltaNeverUsed/Baballonia/tree/libv2l2).

You can install a capture module by placing its `.dll` into your `Modules` folder inside your install directory.
