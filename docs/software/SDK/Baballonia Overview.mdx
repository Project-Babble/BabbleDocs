# Overview of Baballonia SDK

The Baballonia SDK provides developers with the tools and interfaces necessary to integrate eye-tracking and face-tracking capabilities into applications. It works seamlessly with the Baballonia desktop software, giving access to processed tracking data as well as raw camera streams.

## SDK Components

### 1. [`Capture` Class](./Camera%20Stream%20Behavior.mdx)

`Capture` provides the framework that lets developers create their own camera capture sources. By extending the `Capture` class, you define how your camera behaves and how it provides frames to Baballonia.

Baballonia currently supports:

- Standard USB webcams (UVC)
- Varjo eye-tracking cameras
- Android camera streams
- IP cameras
- V4L2 devices on Linux
- Custom or experimental capture sources

### 2. [`ICaptureFactory` Interface](./ICaptureFactory.mdx)

Every custom camera backend must provide a corresponding `ICaptureFactory`. A factory tells Baballonia:

- Whether it can connect to a given camera address (`CanConnect`)
- How to construct the correct `Capture` implementation (`Create`)
- What provider name should appear in the UI and logs (`GetProviderName`)

The capture system and the factory work together: a `Capture` implementation requires an `ICaptureFactory`, and a factory has no purpose without its corresponding `Capture` implementation.
