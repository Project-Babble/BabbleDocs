# SDK

The Baballonia SDK provides developers with the tools necessary to bring eye and face image data into Baballonia.

---

## SDK Components

### 1. [`Capture` Class](/docs/developers/sdk/Capture)

By extending the `Capture` class, you define how your camera behaves and how it provides frames to Baballonia.

---

### 2. [`ICaptureFactory` Interface](./docs/developers/sdk/ICaptureFactory)

Every custom camera backend must provide a corresponding `ICaptureFactory`. A factory tells Baballonia:

- Whether it can connect to a given camera address (`CanConnect`)
- How to construct the correct `Capture` implementation (`Create`)
- What provider name should appear in the UI and logs (`GetProviderName`)

The capture system and the factory work together: a `Capture` implementation requires an `ICaptureFactory`, and a factory has no purpose without its corresponding `Capture` implementation.
