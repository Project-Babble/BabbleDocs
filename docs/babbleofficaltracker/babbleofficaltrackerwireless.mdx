## Setting Up The Camera Feed

Before use, you need to properly set up your camera feed:

1. **Ensure proper positioning**
- Your face should be evenly and well-illuminated
- The tracker should be able to see your entire lower face and jaw
- Positioned at a slight angle that shows the tip of your nose/nostrils

2. **Set the crop area**
- Set the Face Camera into "Cropping" mode
   
![Cropping Mode Button](/img/crop1.png)
   
- Click and drag across the image to set the crop area

- Make sure the cropped area includes:
    - Tip of your nose/nostrils
    - Bottom of your jaw when open
    - Sides of your cheeks when puffed
